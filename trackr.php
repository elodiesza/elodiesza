        <h2>Sample use cases</h3>
        <p>
            </br>1. Most of foreigners moving to South Korea experience noticable hair loss. While doctors blame stress, victims of this phenomenon
            are divided between the country's water quality and air pollution. Trackr could finally find a consensus, or what mostly impacts each person, 
            individually, to prevent further problems.
            </br></br>2. Nelson wants to quit smoking, but his motivation is very irregular. Tracker will not only offer him intrinsic motivation by showing 
            his progress, but also uncover other habits that could influence (or not) his will to return to bad habits.
            </br></br>3. Beata has been suffering from serious headaches during her periods for over 20 years. No doctor was able to find out the cause of her agony.
            Trackr will alow her to track all possible habits that could influence her headaches, and follow-up different habits to check the validity of 
            the correlation and maybe finally overcome this illness she suffered from for decades. Beata is my mom.
        </p></br>
        </br><h2>The story behind it</h3></br>
        <p>
            I have been recording my habits consistently since 2018, first in a notebook, following the bullet journal trend. 
            I realized the power of tracking and the impact it had on my life in 2020 when I moved to Korea with a light luggage,
            leaving it behind. Upon arrival during my quarantine, I decided that it is time to improve my tracking system, learning 
            Swift with the goal of creating a convenient mobile app. As a novice, I went through up and downs, but finally came up
            with a functional version in 2022, and deployed for personal use in 2023. Using it on a daily basis, I am self-testing 
            the functions and optimizing every aspect of it, including UX design that became a new interest of mine.

        <h2>And now ?</h3></br>
        <p>
            I am primarily developping Tracker for my own use and mor my vincinity, so I take my time to develop features I consider useful first.
            I have been using paper bullet books for over 6 years and moved to excel 3 years ago to allow for effective calculation.

            </div>

            </br>I still keep a paper 
            version to keep souvenirs. In fine, I am looking for a way to create an adaptative physical notebook in which I can physically store all data 
            collected on Trackr and customized on the app, to be able to add physical notes and souvenirs such as flight tickets, pictures, cards, etc... 
            Customization and Uniqueness is the essence of Trackr.
        </br>
        </br>
            I am using my beta version of the app on test flight on a daily basis to record my data and it is already more performant and ergonomic than my 
            latest programmed excel file. 
        </br></br> I am currently finishing to develop the algorithm to take into account all types of indicators and include time shifts. In parallel,
            I am working on improving the design, UX and UI.

        <h3>Future functions that could change the game : </h3>
        <p>
        The existing functions of the app already bring a lot of value to the user: But the potential is much bigger than this. Possible ways of expanding the functions are :
        </br></br>- Creating a global database joining all agreeing users’ data in an anonymous way into a common pool to improve recommendation process and decision making based on what works for most people with similar habits.
        </br></br>- Allowing social networking functions such as connecting with people with similar habits/ passions/leisure. This social network would not allow people to share their picture, the main focus will be a person’s activity. This way, the current problem of existing social media : Being unable to judge the potential of a relationship because we are triggered by appearance and faceable discussions rather than actual activities of a person that reveals a lot about someone and the possibility of matching with a person since we do the same things. This will also allow to form groups for activities and share motivational goals, and aspire others to keep up with the group’s progress. 
        </br></br>- A reward function will complement this social media function, making it possible for users to share their accomplishments rewards on the platform or externally on other social medias. Rankings could be done, or competitions/challenges could be organized so people can improve their skills /habits with a tangible goals and give the best of themselves. Challenges, more than competition, can install a positive atmosphere and bring people together to achieve the same goal.
        </br></br>- Reliable marketing tool and tester marketplace : Brands could use the app to find testers for their products by adding the use of their products in their habits and share their results with the world. Tester will be paid a small amount by the brand. If the product is good, the brand will naturally benefit from the good effects proven by the users’ tracks. Since testers are assigned by the app (and not chosen by the brand) the users can be more assured of the reliability of the results not manipulated nay the brand, and be more confident of the good effects of the product if the results are such. It will then help the brand to market the product, and the users to find a product that they will feel confident to buy. Also, it will be interesting to see if the profile of the testers matches the one on the user (for drugs for example, it will be interesting to see if the testers have the same habits as the user who wants to buy the drug, to avoid side effects)
