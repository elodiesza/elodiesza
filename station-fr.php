        <h2>History :</h3></br>
        <p>
        Station FR emerged as a response to the scarcity of accessible and engaging online French teaching resources. As a passionate language learner, I had long observed the limited availability of free language learning materials, leading me to abandon the pursuit of several languages. However, my encounter with a wealth of resources while learning Korean prompted a radical shift in my career and relocation to South Korea. Thoroughly engaging with Talktomeinkorean's lessons and content, I recognized the tremendous impact of such platforms on language learning and even tourism. In gratitude, I decided to pay it forward through Station FR.
        </br></br>Originally conceived for Korean learners, I leveraged my Korean language lessons to draw connections and divergences between our languages. During my stay in South Korea, I dedicated my free time to teaching French to Korean students and independently developed all the content for Station FR. The journey involved constant adaptation, seeking feedback, and iterative refinement until achieving a satisfactory result.
        </br></br>Recognizing that English is more accessible for me, I've made the content available in English, extending the platform's reach to learners worldwide. While French poses challenges with its numerous exceptions, Station FR encourages a step-by-step approach, believing that everyone can overcome the complexities of this beautiful language.
